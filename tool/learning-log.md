* Swift is ran on Xcode (masos version)
* Swift types are grouped in 2 categories: value types and reference types.
  * Value type => ex. structures, enumerations, and tuples are all value types. When you asign a value to a function or method, it is creating a copy.
  * Reference type => ex. classes, actors, and closures are all reference types. It is  a reference with a shared instance that is assigned or passed in.
