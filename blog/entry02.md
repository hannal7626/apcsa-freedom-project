My tool is swift because it is supported by Apple and has intergration with iOS frameworks.
[Chanry](https://github.com/chanryc9471), [David](https://github.com/davidkevinl7792), [Yala](https://github.com/yalah5084) and I are going to make a app that assists people with cooking, it will have recipes but the user could add their own recipe including ingredients and steps that will be shared with everyone else.

<br>
Before, I begin making the app, I want to understand the sytnax of Swift using
[The Basics Documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics).

You could create muliple variables of the same data type in 1 line:<br>
<code>var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 0.0</code>

This is string manipulation:<br>
<code>let greeting = "Hello"
let name = "John"
let personalizedGreeting = "\(greeting), \(name)!"
print(personalizedGreeting)</code>

Then I used [youtube crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Xg7E9shq0U&list=TLPQMDYxMTIwMjNO9FoPe9_46A&index=3) to play around in Xcode. You can see my code in [Hanna Swift](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117mnhurpPyfvKrfNXuWEKhi8vDd9t-bjswmGg0kDv04/edit#bookmark=id.2px17ynjjt7l) and [Why not try](https://docs.google.com/document/d/117mnhurpPyfvKrfNXuWEKhi8vDd9t-bjswmGg0kDv04/edit#bookmark=id.nctxv4m1j90z).


Engineering Development Progress:
I am currently in the Engineering Design Process stages 1, 2, and 3. I have identified a common problem: people struggle with cooking, especially beginner cookers like myself. Creating an app to assist in the cooking process and allowing users to add and share new recipes would be immensely helpful. I am researching ways to address this issue, and my proposed solution is to develop this app.

Skills:
Along learning a new programming language, I am strengthening my skill of How to Google. I use the internet to gather information about Swift, and I apply the same skill to explore cooking recipes. Additionally, I am enhancing my ability to read by studying documents and following the steps outlined in them.
