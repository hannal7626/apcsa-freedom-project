Content:<br>
I have been trying different tutorial exercises to learn Swift. I made [Emojis](../tool/Emojis), Contact page, watched youtube crash courses.

This is my code moments before I transfer my data onto a github repo.

Engineering Development Progress:
I am currently in the Engineering Design Process stages 1, 2, and 3. I have identified a common problem: people struggle with cooking, especially beginner cookers like myself. Creating an app to assist in the cooking process and allowing users to add and share new recipes would be immensely helpful. I am researching ways to address this issue, and my proposed solution is to develop this app.

Skills:
Along learning a new programming language, I am strengthening my skill of How to Google. I use the internet to gather information about Swift, and I apply the same skill to explore cooking recipes. Additionally, I am enhancing my ability to read by studying documents and following the steps outlined in them.
