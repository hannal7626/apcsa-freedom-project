Content: Today marks my final blog for my apcs freedom project. Our cooking app, let me cook is created to bring a positive experience to people that have interest in cooking. Through the journey of creating the app, I have built on multiple skills and learnt from my [elevator pitch](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QTK7AB4jIIhhiGN4qYhdpi7cMnpxjeEvteotyuDWJfU/edit) and [our in-class presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1fzJTYPV8W36z7rmppDt6pjyQiK0mtnq6svw637Mek8o/edit#slide=id.g2dd38bf69af_0_6012). As for takeaways from the elevator pitch, my group and I agreed that we could been more confident of our project, spoke more clearly while we emphasize the purpose/use of our app and  have a backup plan (our code preview wasnâ€™t loading fast enough and so that cut off some of time from judging).  As for takeaways from the in-class presentation, Mr. Mueller suggest to have a slide that explained the purpose of our app, why we decided to use swift and arduino, and have smoother transitions from the swift slides to David's slides. 

Engineering Development Progress (EDP): We are in the engineering design process of 8 where we communicate the results. We recently finished presenting our app to our classmates and we will soon present our presentation in the showcase to other Computer Science classes. In this event, we will celebrate each other's work. 

Skills: I am working on my skill of communication as I will present my work to other classes and communicate my creation to judges with our elevator pitch. In addition, I work on embracing failure. Specifically with being open to accept that there is room for improvement and see what I could takeaway from this experience. For this case that would be the takeaways I found from the elevator pitch and in-class presentation.
